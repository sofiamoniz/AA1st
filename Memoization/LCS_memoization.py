        This function will calculate, using memoization, the len of the 
        longest subsquence between two sequences. This will allow to improve the
        complexity of the problem, once it will avoid the occurence of repeated subtrees, in the tree
        (in the recursive version, it may exist subproblems that are solved several times). 
        Thus, an array will be needed so that we can store these subproblemas results - if we want a
        subproblem solution, first we check if the array already contains it.
