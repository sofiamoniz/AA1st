    Assignment 1: Estrat√©gias de Desenvolvimento de Algoritmos - The Longest Common Subsequence Problem
    Autor: Ana Sofia Medeiros de Castro Moniz Fernandes, 88739

**With this program, it is possible to find the Longest Common Subsquence between two given sequences.
It can be found by using a recursive algorithm; a recursive algorithm using memoization; a dynamic algorithm**

### To run the program:
    Main.py <algorithm to use> <example to use> <optional:show longest subsquence if dynamic alg used>

    Algorithm to use:
        1. -r
        2. -m
        3. -d
    Example to use:
        1. Example1
        2. Example2
        3. Example3
        4. Example4
        5. Example5
        6. Example6
        7. Example7
        8. Example8
    Note: if -d was the chosen algorithm, an optional parameter -s can be passed in order to show the longest common
        subsequence itself

    Example of usage: python3 Main.py -d Example3 -s

### Note:

-**The code is located in the folder "code"**

-**The pdf report can be found in the folder "report"**

-**The fluxograms inserted in the report can be found in the folder "fluxograms", once it may not be perceptible in the pdf in certain devices**
